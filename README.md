# Predictive Analysis: Impact of Alcohol Consumption on Education Quality

This project explores the relationship between alcohol consumption and the education quality of students in Portuguese schools. The analysis specifically focuses on comparing the effects of alcohol consumption on students in Engineering and Business programs and forecasting their interest in higher education.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset Preprocessing**:
  - Utilized **AutoGluon** for efficient data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Addressed missing values, handled outliers, and optimized dataset features for machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implemented **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** models to identify whether alcohol consumption impacts the education quality of students in different academic streams equally.
  - Applied **XGBoost** and **Random Forest Classifiers** to forecast studentsâ€™ interest in higher education, considering tailored academic program features.

- **Key Findings**:
  - Insights into the varying effects of alcohol consumption on academic performance between Engineering and Business students.
  - Predictive modeling of higher education interest with a focus on program-specific preferences.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python Libraries**: AutoGluon, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, classification models, and forecasting.
